# OrbitalView Wallpaper – Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2025-12-29_

## Overview

OrbitalView Wallpaper is a Windows desktop application that sets live satellite imagery as your desktop wallpaper. This app is designed with privacy in mind and does not collect, store, or share personal data.

## Data Collection

OrbitalView Wallpaper:

- Does **not** collect any personally identifiable information (PII).
- Does **not** collect usage analytics or telemetry.
- Does **not** track your activity or behavior.

No personal or device-identifying data is sent to the developer or to third parties.

## Network Connections

OrbitalView Wallpaper connects to external servers only to:

- Download satellite imagery from the NOAA/NESDIS/STAR infrastructure.

These requests are standard HTTP/HTTPS image downloads similar to loading images in a web browser. The app does not send any additional information beyond what is required by normal network communication (such as your IP address, which is handled by your ISP and the remote server).

## Local Storage

The app stores the following data locally on your device:

- Configuration files (e.g., selected region, refresh intervals, and app preferences).
- Cached satellite images used for wallpapers.

These files are stored in your user profile directory (for example, under `%APPDATA%\OrbitalViewWallpaper\`) and remain on your device. You may delete these files at any time; the app will recreate them as needed.

## Third Parties

OrbitalView Wallpaper relies on:

- **NOAA/NESDIS/STAR** for satellite imagery.

The app does not embed third-party analytics SDKs or advertising frameworks.

## Children’s Privacy

OrbitalView Wallpaper does not target or collect personal data from children.
